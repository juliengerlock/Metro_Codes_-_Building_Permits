# Metro Codes Building Permits

## Data Question

For this project you will use data provided by the _Codes_ Department for Metro Nashville. You will aim to answer the question:  
__*What is an expected timeframe for each construction type and workflow type?*__


More precisely:  
`For each permit type, how long does it take from application to complete review for the different workflow items?  So, for example, if it is a new commercial permit, the average time for Water Services to complete their review is ‘X’ amount of time and the average time it takes to get a U&O letter is ‘Y’ from application start and/or from issuance.`

This is the main question to answer but feel free expand your analysis to look for other insights that interest you.


## Data files

### Initiated Building Permits

This file includes all building permits that were created with the given timeframe.

Fields Included:

`Permit #` – This number is autogenerated, if there is a T before the number then it is still an application and the T is removed once Issued.  Same goes for D at the beginning but indicates that it was started on ePermits but the application was never completed.  
`Case Type` – (Permit Type) – Commercial types start with CAC and Residential Types start with CAR.  
`Case Type Desc` – This will state the type of work being done: New, Addition, Rehab, etc.  
`Sub Type` – (Permit subtype)  
`Sub type Desc` – (Permit Subtype description) – This will give a better understanding of location type: Single Family Home, Airport, Religious, Duplex, etc.  
`Construction Cost` – This cost is determined by Codes in most cases  
`Square Footage` – This is not always included but it is for most new construction  
`Status Code` – (Permit Status) – Permit statuses go from Open, Issued, to Done (once the final inspection is approved or the U&O is issued)  
`Date Initiated` – (Date Created) – This is the date that the application for permit was created in the system  
`Date Issued` – This date will only be populated once the permit has been issued (after all required reviews are completed and fees are paid)  
 

### Initiated Building Permits (CA, FR, PL, PW, SW, or WS)
